StQPs are generally not convex and belong to the class of NP-hard problems. In this thesis work, a fast decomposition algorithm, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), was applied to the StQPs with the aim of approaching as much as possible to the global minimum of the problem. The SMO algorithm was used as a local solver within a global optimization strategy.</description></item></channel></rss>
